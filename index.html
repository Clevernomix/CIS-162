    <p>My name is Luis and I grew up in the city of <em>Paramount</em>. 
       I have been married now for <em>16 years</em> and have 2 sons and 3 dogs.
       I am a Manufacturing Engineer at a water pump manufacturing
       company and I really enjoy my job. I have been living in the city of 
       La Mirada now for 4 years and so far I love everything about it. My hopes
       are to continue to learn all that I can to eventually have my own business
       in manufacturing.</p>
