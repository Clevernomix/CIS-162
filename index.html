    <p>My name is Luis and I grew up in the city of <em>Paramount</em>. 
       I have been married now for <em>16 years</em> and have 2 sons and 3 dogs.
       I am a <e>Manufacturing Engineer</e> at a water pump manufacturing
       company and I really enjoy my job. I have been living in the city of 
       La Mirada now for 4 years and so far I love everything about it. My hopes
       are to continue to learn all that I can to eventually have my own business
       in manufacturing.</p>

   <h1>When I have free time I like to:</h1>
   <ul type="square">   
      <li> Go offroading!</li>
      <li> Work on my cars.</li>
      <li> Go hicking with my family.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com">BibleGateway.com</a> 
    because it makes it very easy for me to study the Bible.</p>
